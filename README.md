The project FDI Analysis is about Foreign Direct Investment in India from different sectors.
like as Chemical ,Electronic ,Medical ,Education, Pharmacy ..etc.
The data contains information starting from 2000 to 2017 concerning FDI Investment in their respected sectors.

#Analysis:

For the analysis, I have used Tableau Desktop  Version 4.01.
The first step is to data cleanup it contains some null values. 
for data cleanup, I have used The Data Interpreter Function Which is Inbuild function provided by Tableau to clean the dataset,
It removes all the null values in dataSet.
after cleanup, I made the same changes in data for myself and loaded it into the sheet.
For analysis, I prepared some questions so that it made it easy to perform information extraction from a dataset.

# Questions :
Which are the TOP 10 sectors that have Maximum FDI?
Which are the bottom 10 Sectors that have Minimum FDI?
In which year the FDI was Maximum? and its related Sectors?
group the sectors and show their FDI?
Estimate the FDI in the next years?
Rank the sectors depending on their FDI?
Create sets for similar years FDI was Minumum.?

These are some questions that I try to solve using FDI DataSet.
