# Discription about DataSet.:-

The project is about the Movies Dataset of Netflix.
it has 5043 rows and 19 columns.
the dataset describes different Movies watched over all the wold
Like the type of movies Horror, comedy, Romantic, adventure,
sci-fi, action, biography... etc.
it also has information about the ratings and reviews about the movies.

#Analysis:

For the analysis, I have used Tableau Desktop  Version 4.01.
The first step is to data cleanup it contains some null values. 
Later on, I have created a new sheet on a given dataset as Actors.
for data cleanup, I have used The Data Interpreter Function Which is Inbuild function provided by Tableau to clean the dataset,
It removes all the null values in dataSet.
after cleanup, I made the same changes in data for myself and loaded it into the sheet.
For analysis, I prepared some questions so that it made it easy to perform information extraction from a dataset.
